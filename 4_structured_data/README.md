# Structured data
Using structured data makes your life easier.

[`Inspector`](https://github.com/Maggi-Chen/Inspector)'s summary output is an example of what you should avoid.
* It is not easily serializable.
* Everyone who wants to use this output must build their own script to parse it.
* Mixed tabs and headers on multiple lines.

## Demonstration
To run the script:
```bash
python structured_data/scripts/parse_summary_statistics.py 
```
