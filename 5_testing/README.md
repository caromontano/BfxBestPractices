# Testing
Testing is important process in bioinformatics method development.
* No different from having controls in wet-lab experiments.

In Python, this is fairly easy with `pytest`.
```bash
pytest -v 5_testing/scripts/test_basic.py
```

# Example:
Read the output of this command and fix the failing test.
```bash
pytest -v 5_testing/scripts/test_files.py
```
